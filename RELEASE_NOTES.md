# css4j-dom4j version 1.3.0 Release Notes

### February 15, 2022

<br/>

## Release Highlights

### `:dir()` pseudo-class

The `:dir()` pseudo-class is now partially supported in computed styles.

Full support could not be implemented due to dom4j's limited DOM support.

Users are advised to switch to css4j's native DOM if they need a full `:dir`
implementation.

### Build

The build system was switched from Maven to Gradle.
