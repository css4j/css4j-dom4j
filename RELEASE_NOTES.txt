Description
-----------
 This software contains Java(tm) classes that leverage the DOM4J library to use
CSS4J. Unless otherwise noted, this software is provided under a BSD-style
licence (see the LICENSE.txt file).

 This css4j-dom4j module uses documents and elements that extend those of dom4j
(it is intended for those who are comfortable with dom4j).


Java(tm) Runtime Environment requirements
-----------------------------------------
 All the classes in the binary package have been compiled with a Java compiler
set to 1.8 compiler compliance level, except the module-info file.

 Building the library requires JDK 15 or higher, although the resulting jar
files can be run with a 1.8 JRE.


Software dependencies
=====================

 To build this library you need:

- The css4j artifact (and its transitive dependencies); version 3.6.0 or higher
  is recommended (compatibility with 4.0 or higher is not guaranteed):
  https://github.com/css4j/css4j/releases

- The css4j-agent artifact; version 3.6.0 or higher is recommended
  (compatibility with 4.0 or higher is not guaranteed):
  https://github.com/css4j/css4j-agent/releases
  It is optional at runtime.

- The dom4j JAR package (tested with 2.1.1). Requires at least version 2.0 to
  compile and 2.1.1 to run the tests, but you should be able to run the
  resulting jar file with dom4j 1.6 if you are stuck with it.
